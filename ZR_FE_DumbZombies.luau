    Zombie Rush Vulnerability Proof of Concept
    Discovered by 4RR6R

    This script demonstrates a server-side velocity desynchronization issue
    affecting AI target prediction mechanics
    While this technique can also be used to fling zombies or players
    outside of the map boundaries (when playing as a zombie), that is
    not the primary purpose of this proof of concept

    Status: Functional

    Created for security research and responsible disclosure purposes only

		humanoidRootPart.AssemblyLinearVelocity = Vector3.new(math.cos(tick()), 0, math.sin(tick())) * 50 -- Vulnerability is here -> Velocity desynchronization
